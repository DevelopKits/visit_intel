If you have a SWR shared object library, you'll need to add it to the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so that it can be loaded by VisIt.
The following command will update the variable:

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/SWR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The reason I have put the library file location first is that this should
prevent VisIt from loading GL/Mesa before SWR.

Once done, cd to the VisIt test directory. For example, I go to:

$ cd /export/ahota/visit/visit2.8.1/test

The test directory is alongside the src and data directories in a source build.
To run the tests, use this command:

$ ./visit_test_suite -n 1 --pixdiff=8 --avgdiff=5

The '-n 1' option makes the tests run serially in a single thread. I chose this
to make sure there were no errors caused by multi-threaded performance.
However the downside is that the full test suite will take a few hours to
complete.

The pixdiff and avgdiff options allow for some differences between the
rendered and baseline images without marking the images as failed. These values
are somewhat arbitrary, but provide a reasonably low false-positive rate in
the results
